Manipulating text:

Insertion Commands:
  - These all leave you in insert mode
  - i insert before current character
  - I insert at beginning of line
  - a append after current character
  - A append at end of line
  - o insert blank line below current line and enter insert mode in it.
  - O insert blank line above current line and enter insert mode in it.

Copy/Paste Commands:
  - x delete character under cursor
  - y yank(copy)
  - p paste
  - d delete(cut)
  - yy yank line
  - dd delete line

Undo/Redo
  - u undo
  - Ctrl-r redo

Replacing/Substitution/Changing
  - s substitute character(s)
  - S substitute line (Deletes current line and puts you in insert mode at beginning)
  - r replace character
  - R replace line (Puts you in replace/overwrite mode for rest of the line)
  - ~ Change case
  - c change (deletes and puts you in insert mode)
  - C Change to end of line

Putting it all together:
  - movement + manipulation = power
  - You can combine your manipulation commands (verbs) with your movement commands(nouns) to quickly edit text.
  - In addition you can use additional modifiers (adjectives) to further refine your commands.

Examples:

Yank(copy) 4 characters right: y4l
Yank 2 characters left: y2h

Delete (from cursor) to end of a word: dw
Delete entire word: diw (iw == inside word, i is a modifier)
Delete two words: d2w
Delete two entire words: d2iw
Delete to the end of the line: d$
Delete two words back: d2b

Change entire word: ciw
Change inside (a set of parenthesis): ci) (or ] or } or ' or ")
Change upto (and including) }: cf}
Change upto (excluding) ": ct"

And the possibilities go on...
